Insertion sort works fine on small data, but becomes extremely slow as data grows (O(nÂ²) time complexity). 
At 100k elements, it is practically unusable.

Merge sort much faster than insertion sort on medium/large inputs thanks to O(n log n) complexity, 
but still slower than Python's built-in sort.

Timsort (Python's built-in sort) is clearly the fastest across all sizes. 
It's combination of merge sort and insertion sort makes it well optimized for real-world data patterns 
and, in most cases, the best choice for developers.
